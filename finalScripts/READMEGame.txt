Our game was developed and tested in unity version 2020.3.21f1
The python script was tested in python 3.8 with the following packages

Open CV 2
pip install opencv-python
Media Pipe
pip install mediapipe
Numpy
pip install numpy



The following open source codes were used for the pose detection algorithm 
and communication between python and unity

Communication between Python and Unity Open Source

In order to run our project, you need to open the unity project in unity
and run it

While that's running, run the python script, you will need to have a webcam
attached, or the code will not work.


Then stand back so your body in entirely in frame of the webcam, and read the
text in the unity window which tells you to cross your hands above your head
for a few seconds in order to calibrate.

Once calibrated, you can choose a game mode by either putting your hands to 
the left side of the screen or the right.

If you die or win the game (standard mode), you can go back to the menu by
holding both of your hands above your head for a few seconds (not crossed)


Please let me (Liam) or Kritu know if you have any difficulties
