Movement options

- Left, Right, Jump, Duck


Create a 3x3 grid which controls the amount we move

for example: for going left, we could have
0 0 x
0 0 x
0 0 x

or 

0 x x
0 x x
0 x x

Where we need to dodge the xs here, so either we can just stay in the centre (one x) or actually left (two xs)

This can also be applied for right. For jumping, we only want a single jump or duck level.
Jump
0 0 0
0 0 0
x x x

or Duck
x x x
0 0 0
0 0 0

As it progresses, it gets faster, for the demo
L = centre left
LL = really left
R = centre right
RR = really right
D = duck
J = jump

Done


For expansion, mulitple of these movements can be done together, an instead of just having to perform one actiion based on objects coming towards you, we can force holding an action (floor disappears), and perform other actiions during that. We can also require the grabbing of items, and use of those items for pushing things or something like that.

For exmaple

RRJ
Would require you to go to the right, then jump
